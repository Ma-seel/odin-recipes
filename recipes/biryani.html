        <h2>Steps you should follow</h2>
        <h3>Preparation :</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Marinate the Meat:</b> In a bowl, mix the chicken or lamb pieces with yogurt, biryani masala, turmeric, red chili powder, cumin, coriander, garlic, ginger, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight for best results.</li>
            <li><b>Prepare the Rice:</b> Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><b>Fry the Onions:</b> In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown and crispy. Remove half for garnishing later.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cook the Biryani:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Cook the Meat:</b> Add the marinated meat to the pot with the remaining onions. Cook over medium heat until the meat is browned and cooked through, about 10-15 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li><b>Add Tomatoes and Spices:</b> Stir in the diced tomatoes and cook until they break down and blend into the sauce. Adjust seasoning with additional salt if needed.</li>
            <li><b>Layer the Biryani:</b> In a separate pot, bring water or chicken broth to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water. Cook until the rice is 70% cooked (it should still have a bite). Drain the rice and layer it over the cooked meat mixture. Sprinkle with saffron threads, fresh cilantro, and mint. Cover tightly with a lid.</li>
            <li><b>Simmer:</b> Reduce the heat to low and cook the biryani for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook. Avoid lifting the lid frequently.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Serve:</h3>
        <ul>Once cooked, gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Garnish with the reserved crispy onions and additional fresh cilantro and mint if desired. Serve hot with raita or a side salad.</ul>
