        <h2>Steps you should follow</h2>
        <h3>Preparation :</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Preheat Oven:</b> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
            <li><b>Cream Butter and Sugars:</b> In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li><b>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</b> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, until well combined.</li>
            <li><b>Combine Dry Ingredients:</b> In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li><b>Mix Dry Ingredients:</b> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined.</li>
            <li><b>Add Chocolate Chips and Nuts:</b> Fold in the chocolate chips and nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Shape and Bake:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Form Cookies:</b> Use a cookie scoop or tablespoon to drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li><b>Bake:</b> Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked but will continue to set as they cool.</li>
            <li><b>Cool:</b> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Serve:</h3>
        <ul>Once cooled, enjoy your freshly baked cookies with a glass of milk, coffee, or on their own as a delicious treat!</ul>
